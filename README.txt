The program has few requirements to be set up, but itâ€™s important to drag the SeatBookerLogFiles folder 
into the documents folder in your user folder.

To reset the states of the seats, you just need to turn all the Bs into As in SeatStatus.txt 
before you run the program

Also in order to open the .sln file you will need Visual Studio

Alternatively the bin folder contains the .exe file that you should be able to run on any windows pc

If you need any confirmation that the code is my own original work, the teach that should be writing my
reference is Mr Tim Milkins, he should be able to confirm that the code is mine, as this code was
written for an assessment.
